" Description:  {{{
"   This file sets the 'makeprg' and 'errorformat' options for the LaTeX
"   compiler. It is customizable to optionally ignore certain warnings and
"   provides the ability to set a dynamic 'ignore-warning' level.
"
"   By default it is set up in a 'non-verbose', 'ignore-common-warnings' mode,
"   which means that irrelevant lines from the compilers output will be
"   ignored and also some very common warnings are ignored.
"   
"   Depending on the 'ignore-level', the following kinds of messages are
"   ignored. An ignore level of 3 for instance means that messages 1-3 will be
"   ignored. By default, the ignore level is set to 4. 
"
"   1. LaTeX Warning: Specifier 'h' changed to 't'. 
"      This errors occurs when TeX is not able to correctly place a floating
"      object at a specified location, because of which it defaulted to the
"      top of the page.
"   2. LaTeX Warning: Underfull box ...
"   3. LaTeX Warning: Overfull box ...
"      both these warnings (very common) are due to \hbox settings not being
"      satisfied nicely.
"   4. LaTeX Warning: You have requested ..., 
"      This warning occurs in slitex when using the xypic package.
"   5. Missing number error:
"      Usually, when the name of an included eps file is spelled incorrectly,
"      then the \bb-error message is accompanied by a bunch of "missing
"      number, treated as zero" error messages. This level ignores these
"      warnings.
"      NOTE: number 5 is actually a latex error, not a warning!
"
"   Use 
"       TCLevel <level>
"   where level is a number to set the ignore level dynamically.
"
"   When TCLevel is called with the unquoted string strict
"      TClevel strict
"    then the 'efm' switches to a 'verbose', 'no-lines-ignored' mode which is
"    useful when you want to make final checks of your document and want to be
"    careful not to let things slip by.
" 
" TIP: MikTeX has a bug where it sometimes erroneously splits a line number
"      into multiple lines. i.e, if the warning is on line 1234. the compiler
"      output is:
"      LaTeX Warning: ... on input line 123
"      4.
"      In this case, vim will wrongly interpret the line-number as 123 instead
"      of 1234. If you have cygwin, a simple remedy around this is to first
"      copy the file vimlatex (provided) into your $PATH, make sure its
"      executable and then set the variable g:tex_flavor to vimlatex in your
"      ~/.vimrc (i.e putting let "g:tex_flavor = 'vimlatex'" in your .vimrc).
"      This problem occurs rarely enough that its not a botheration for most
"      people.
"
" TODO:
"   1. menu items for dynamically selecting a ignore warning level.

" Customization of 'makeprg': {{{

" There are several alternate ways in which 'makeprg' is set up. 
"
" Case 1
" ------
" The first is when this file is a part of latex-suite. In this case, a
" variable called g:Tex_DefaultTargetFormat exists, which gives the default
" format .tex files should be compiled into. In this case, we use the TTarget
" command provided by latex-suite.
"
" Case 2
" ------
" The user is using this file without latex-suite AND he wants to directly
" specify the complete 'makeprg'. Then he should set the g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi
" variable. This is a string which should be directly be able to be cast into
" &makeprg. An example of one such string is:
"
" 	g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi = 'pdflatex \\nonstopmode \\input\{$*\}'
"
" NOTE: You will need to escape back-slashes, {'s etc yourself if you are
"       using this file independently of latex-suite.
" TODO: Should we also have a check for backslash escaping here based on
"       platform?
"
" Case 3
" ------
" The use is using this file without latex-suite and he doesnt want any
" customization. In this case, this file makes some intelligent guesses based
" on the platform. If he doesn't want to specify the complete 'makeprg' but
" only the name of the compiler program (for example 'pdflatex' or 'latex'),
" then he sets b:tex_flavor or g:tex_flavor.

	"
	" After a %[OPQ] is matched, the %r part is passed to the same and
	" following patterns. Hence, we have to add many $[OPQ]-patterns.
	"
	" If you use vim to compile your documents, you might want to use
	"     :let $max_print_line=1024
	" such that latex will not wrap the filenames. Otherwise, you could use it
	" as an environment variable or simply use
	"     max_print_line=1024 pdflatex ...

	"     $ENV{'max_print_line'} = '1024';
	"     $log_wrap = $ENV{'max_print_line'};
	" in your ~/.latexmkrc

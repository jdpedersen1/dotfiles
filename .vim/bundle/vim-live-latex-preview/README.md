Note: 
- `bin/` contains some shell scripts used by the plugin. Add it to your `PATH`.
- Some code in `ftplugin/tex/live-latex-preview.vim` is commented. That part is not necessary for `pathogen` or `Vundle` users.

Warning:
- This is an unofficial clone of vim-live-latex-preview by Kevin C. Klement <klement@philos.umass.edu>
- For licence info and more details please visit https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vim-live-latex-preview.
- I do not have a Linux box and can no longer test whether this plugin is working properly with ``evince``.

My current setup:
- TeXmacs (www.texmacs.org) for quick note taking and drafting (which can be exported into LaTeX)
- TeXShop with personal macros for more serious editing
- Video tutorials of TeXmacs: http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/home/videos.en.html
